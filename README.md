## Game-changer: **PARACHUTES** <img width="18" alt="image" src="https://github.com/NguyenChHieu/Tanks/assets/140675996/15e698cd-8e5e-422d-84dd-580ff98105ed">

+ Picture this: your tank hovering in midair, the terrain below crumbling from the impact of a projectile.
+ That's when you deploy your trusty parachute, gently guiding your tank down at a controlled pace, unscathed. But watch out, you've only got **three parachutes per game!**
+ If you're out of parachutes, brace for impact as your tank falls faster, taking damage with each pixel of height.

**It's all about timing and resource management in the midst of chaos!**
